Welcome to the repository of our [Year 2 Ensae Data Science project](https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/)!  

# Presentation of the project 

The topic of our study is to **build an optimised portfolio of cryptocurrencies**, by maximising the expected gains over a given period of time and arbitraging this against a given risk profile of an investor. 

To do so, we followed three steps:  

(1) **Price prediction (the expected gains)**. We first determined a suitable model to predict prices (our expected gains),

(2) **Volatility forecasting (Risk profile)**. Another model is then identified to predict future volatility (our given risk profile).

In turn, these two aforementioned models allow us to:

(3) **Build an efficient frontier** that models this risk-return arbitrage in finance theory. 

In short, optimising an efficient frontier allows to get the required proportions to invest in certain cryptocurrencies as we model this risk-return arbitrage, which is the goal of our study. 

# Motivation 

The motivation behind our study stems from both the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency as a financial asset and the rampant transformative potential of machine learning in modern society.

**Taming the potential of cryptocurrencies** (more particularly Bitcoin) **as a possible 'safe haven' asset** ('valeur refuge'). Understandably, Bitcoin is becoming seen more and more as a 'safe haven' asset. Indeed, its compounded returns are way more attractive than traditional financial instruments, such as bonds ('obligations'), insurance products or savings accounts. Big warning however, is its extreme volatility: Bitcoin is not only seen as a potential future 'safe haven', but also as a financial bubble ready to burst anytime. Therefore, successfully balancing this risk-return trade-off through portfolio optimisation could pave the way for using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a viable safe-haven asset in the future (though mostly unlikely at the present moment. As we bear this in mind, our project is a first attempt in achieving that aim). 

**Additional reason to tame this risk-return potential of crypto: the current growth of crypto market value**. Recent news such as the re-election of Donald Trump caused a steady increase of the value of Bitcoin. On top of this, curreny global geopolitical and economic disruptions are one ofdrivers  
encore plus depuis l'avenement de trump, les cryptos ont grimpé : encore plus une raison de savoir bien gerer ce risk-gain arbitrage

on a more personal note, l'usage du machine learning : utile de plus en plus pour la societe, transformatif dans le siecle - c’est une evidence. Pouvoir utiliser de tels modeles groundbreaking nous permet d'Appliquer ca a l’economie, ici sur un segment du marché financier. a terme, pourrait surement meme mieux gerer les marches. 

On va le voir qu'on reussit a repondre a ces trois aspects
