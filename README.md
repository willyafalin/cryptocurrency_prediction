Welcome to the repository of our [Year 2 Ensae Data Science project](https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/)!  

# Presentation of the project 

The topic of our study is to **build an optimised portfolio of cryptocurrencies**, by maximising the expected gains over a given period of time and arbitraging this against a given risk profile of an investor. 

To do so, we followed three steps:  

(1) **Price prediction (the expected gains)**. We first determined a suitable model to predict prices (our expected gains),

(2) **Volatility forecasting (Risk profile)**. Another model is then identified to predict future volatility (our given risk profile).

In turn, these two aforementioned models allow us to:

(3) **Build an efficient frontier** that models this risk-return arbitrage in finance theory. 

In short, optimising an efficient frontier allows to get the required proportions to invest in certain cryptocurrencies as we model this risk-return arbitrage, which is the goal of our study. 

# Motivation 

The motivation behind our study stems from both the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency as a financial asset and the rampant transformative potential of machine learning in modern society.

**Taming the potential of cryptocurrencies** (more particularly Bitcoin) **as a possible 'safe haven' asset** ('valeur refuge'). Understandably, Bitcoin is becoming seen more and more as a 'safe haven' asset. Indeed, its compounded returns are way more attractive than traditional financial instruments, such as bonds ('obligations'), insurance products or savings accounts. Big warning however, is its extreme volatility: Bitcoin is not only seen as a potential future 'safe haven', but also as a financial bubble ready to burst anytime. Therefore, successfully balancing this risk-return trade-off through portfolio optimisation could pave the way for using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a viable safe-haven asset in the future (though mostly unlikely at the present moment. As we bear this in mind, our project is a first attempt in achieving that aim). 

**Additional reason to tame this risk-return potential of crypto: the current growth of crypto market value**. Recent news such as the re-election of Donald Trump caused a steady increase of the value of Bitcoin. On top of this, current global geopolitical and the economic disruptions that followed are one of the many drivers for finding new safe assets to invest in. 

**The use of Machine learning in our project**. On a more personal note, it is increasingly established that Machine Learning has a transformative potential in this century, with far-reaching societal implications. Our project reflects our interest in applying machine learning models to address real-world problems, more specifically applied to financial economics issues. 
on a more personal note, l'usage du machine learning : utile de plus en plus pour la societe, transformatif dans le siecle - câ€™est une evidence. By leveraging ML models that are groundbreaking, we can apply this innovation to the economy. Here, targeting a specific segment of the financial market. Over time, such approaches could even improve the management of financial markets on a broader scale.

In this project, we try to address these three motivations.
